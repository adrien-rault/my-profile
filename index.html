        <p>Let me tell you a bit about myself! I'm from Lintgen in Luxembourg, a small village in a very small country wedged between France, Belgium, and Germany. I was born and brought up there, although I am of French and Austrian origin. I have an older brother who is currently studying in Paris. I speak four languages: French, English, German, and a little Spanish. I'm always looking to try and discover new things, my main traits being that I'm adventurous, friendly, and always in a good mood. I can't wait to tell you more about me!</p>

    <div id="passionsInterests" class="section font-styles">
        <h2>My Passions and Interests</h2>
        <p>I have many passions, including basketball, music, travel, perfume, and gastronomy. Each of these has played an important role in shaping the person I am today, and I'm looking forward to delving deeper into each of them.</p>

    <div id="basketball" class="section font-styles">
        <h2>Basketball</h2>
        <p>My love of basketball revolves around my admiration for the San Antonio Spurs of the NBA, in particular, Kawhi Leonard, Tony Parker, and Victor Wembenyama. I'm also a big fan of European teams like Monaco and Barcelona. Although I started playing basketball relatively late, at the age of 14, I still managed to become Luxembourg Under-18 champion. To improve my game, I took part in various camps and tournaments in France, Belgium, and Germany. These experiences not only improved my skills but also fuelled my passion for the sport, motivating me to strive for excellence every time I took to the court.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="music" class="section font-styles">
        <h2>Music</h2>
        <p>Music has always been a big part of my life. I love listening to French and American rap and pop, especially artists like Frank Ocean, Rounhaa, and Drake. Their songs touch me in different ways, whether it's the smooth vibes of Frank Ocean or the energetic rhythms of Drake. I love immersing myself in the music, understanding the stories behind the lyrics and the creative production. It's like exploring a whole new world with each song, and that brings me a lot of joy and excitement.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="travelling" class="section font-styles">
        <h2>Travelling</h2>
        <p>I've been lucky enough to travel to many parts of the world, particularly Europe. I've explored many countries, including Spain and Italy, where I've spent a lot of time. I love discovering new places, whether with family, friends, or on my own. Spain and Italy are two of my favourite destinations, with their delicious food, beautiful scenery, and fascinating history. I love to travel and always look forward to the new adventures that await me.</p>

    <div id="perfumery" class="section font-styles">
        <h2>Perfumery</h2>
        <p>When it comes to fragrances, my favorites are without doubt MFK and Tom Ford. Their fragrances resonate with me on a deeper level, each offering a unique olfactory experience. From the sophisticated blends of Francis Kurkdjian to the bold, luxurious creations of Tom Ford, I'm drawn to their distinct styles and impeccable craftsmanship. Whether it's the evocative notes of MFK's Baccarat Rouge 540 or the sensual allure of Tom Ford's Black Orchid, these brands consistently deliver fragrances that leave a lasting impression.</p>

    <div id="gastronomy" class="section font-styles">
        <h2>Gastronomy</h2>
        <p>When it comes to cooking, I love French, Italian, and Japanese cuisine. Each of them has its own particular flavors that I can't get enough of. French cuisine, with its rich sauces and pastries, is always a treat. Italian dishes, like pasta and pizza, are so comforting and delicious. And Japanese cuisine, with its sushi and sashimi, is both delicate and tasty. Exploring the different foods of these cultures is always exciting for me.</p>
